        "Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.",
        "Not all those who wander are lost.",
        "So do I, and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.",
        "There's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for."
